# TestCoulomb
This program will help you in your Coulomb's Law exercises 
## How to use it?
First you need to install the NumPy module:
`pip install numpy`

The notation for the input of the program is:
- If you have a charge like  -1 pC convert it into −1.00E − 12 before enter the data
- Once you have your converted charge **Example: −1.00E − 12** put it in this form: **-1E-12**
- If it's decimal it should look like this: **−2.50E − 01** -> **-2.50E-01**
